# Clustering Based Anomaly Detection

## Description
This clustering based anomaly detection project implements unsupervised clustering algorithms on the [NSL-KDD](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1b34/80021c4ab0f632efa99e01a9b073903c5554.pdf) and [IDS 2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) datasets. The project includes options for preprocessing the datasets. It then clusters the datasets, mainly using the K-means and DBSCAN algorithms. Finally, it evaluates the clustering performed by the algorithms using standard metrics such as F-Score.
