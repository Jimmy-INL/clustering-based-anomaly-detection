# Clustering Based Anomaly Detection

# Description
For this clustering based anomaly detection project, we used the NSL-KDD and IDS 2017 datasets to implement clustering algorithms in them, mainly we use K-means and DBSCAN algorithms, then we evaluate those results using evaluation metrics and obtain results.
