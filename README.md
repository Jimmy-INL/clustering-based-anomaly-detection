# Clustering Based Anomaly Detection

## Description
For this clustering based anomaly detection project, we used the [NSL-KDD](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1b34/80021c4ab0f632efa99e01a9b073903c5554.pdf) and [IDS 2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) datasets to implement clustering algorithms in them, mainly we use K-means and DBSCAN algorithms, then we evaluate those results using evaluation metrics and obtain results.

## Prerequisites

* [Python >= 3.5](https://www.python.org/)
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/#)
* [NumPy](http://numpy.org/)
* [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
*[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)

## Installation

For this project, we installed Anaconda-Navigator to use as our package and environment manager. Under the Environments tab in Anaconda, we created an environment and downloaded the libraries listed in the prerequisites for this project.
